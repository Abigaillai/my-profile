		<h2>Hobbies and passions.</h2>
		<p>
			My hobbies are watching old movies and reading. The movies I regularly watch are those from the 90s and early 2000s. I love them as they give me a nolstagic feeling and I like some of the actors and actresses in the era.  Reading is also a hobby I recently picked up. I am currently reading a psychology book, The Laws Of Human Nature by Robert Greene. It talks about why people do what they do and how you can use both your own psychological flaws and those of others to your advantage at work, in relationships, and in life.
